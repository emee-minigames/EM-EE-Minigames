        So EM-EE Minigames is a game inspired by EPIC Minigames. This game is just made by 1 young child and this website is made by me as well ;D [HOPE YOU LIKE IT!]
        <br><br>
        This is the first game which is officially released — the other games are just trash and not really worked on.
        <br><br>
        EM-EE Minigames has 2 teams: <strong>EM-</strong> represents Fox and <strong>EE-</strong> represents Crown.
        <br><br>
        People can host events by making challenges of who will reach the end and get first!
        <br><br>
        The first minigame of EM-EE Minigames was <strong>SpinningTopTower</strong> and the second was <strong>MountainClimb</strong>.
        <br><br>
        There are different zones in which you can go by completing very difficult minigames. For example, you can enter the Champion Realm by completing the TryhardObby of Newbie Realm.
        <br><br>
        The currency of the game is called <strong>'EM-EE Bit Coins'</strong>, which can be obtained by completing different types of minigames.
        <br><br>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> Not all minigames give you coins — some are just made for fun!
        <br><br>
        With the 'EM-EE Bit Coins', you can purchase an <strong>EM-EE Card</strong> which allows you to buy special stuff. You can also purchase tools with Bit Coins.
        <br><br>
        In the future, I will add FREE UGCs in exchange for money. Therefore, please support the game! Thank you and have a great day!
